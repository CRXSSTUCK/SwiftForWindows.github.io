Any other patch or any pull request, as well as my own, can be included this site.\r\n\r\n### Swift for Cygwin\r\n(Cygwin)[https://cygwin.com/] is a Linux feeling environment for Windows. Currently Swift is porting on 2.5.2 64bit version, and the basic sample for Foundation can be run. But many test script will fail.\r\n\r\n### Swift for MinGW\r\n(Mingw-w64)[http://mingw-w64.org/] is an advancement fork of (MinGW)[http://mingw.org/]. MinGW is a minimalist development environment for GCC compiling on Windows. Simple Hello.swift can be run, but Foundation is not yet ported.\r\n\r\n### Swift for MSVC\r\nMSVC in here means the MS C Runtime libraries in Visual Studio 2013/2015 or later. Unlikely Cygwin or MinGW, this port does not have glibc library.\r\n\r\n### Current Status\r\nTBD",
